# Terrors of Nowhere: Save Manager

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eQvudxo.png" alt="preview">

This tool will keep track of your Saved States so you can play and recover your data later. It also saves every save state into a local json file to keep them in your computer.

## How does it work?

The program will monitor your logs at `%LOCALAPPDATA%Low\VRChat\VRChat` and detect logged save states.

## Is this against VRChats ToS?

This is an external tool that uses local plain text files that VRChat writes to the Local APPDATA folder.

It does not modify or alter the game in any way. This is not a mod or a cheat.
